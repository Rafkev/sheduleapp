Dart console application for event scheduling
This App written with Dart for Flutter allows users to add events with a date and time and view all scheduled events.

This Dart program provides a simple menu-driven interface where users can choose to add events, view scheduled events, or exit the program. Each event has a title, date, and time. The events are stored in a list.
